GitHub Actions automate software development workflows. It consists of individual tasks called as actions
which can be combine to create a custom workflows.
1. Workflows:
    - Workflows are bunch of actions which performs certain tasks.
    - Workflows are custom automated processes that can be set-up in a repository to build, test, package,
      release or deploy any code project on GitHub.
    - An example of workflow can be testing and deploying a code when someone pushes to master branch or
      run some test when someone opens a pull request or issues.
    - Workflows can be run on a schedule based instance. Like run the test on 6 p.m everyday.
    - Workflows can also be run when an external events take place outside of GitHub.
    - A Workflow contains one or more jobs and all the workflows run on a virtual machine.

2. Events:
    - Events on GitHub are like push, pull request or any issues etc. Due to such types of events workflows
      are triggered. 

3. Jobs:
    - Each workflows have multiple numbers of jobs and each jobs has some number steps perform.
    - A step can consits of some sorts of commands or actions.
    - Jobs can run parellel or they can have dependence on each other. 

4. A Runner:
    - A runner is an any machine with the GitHub Actions runner application installed.
    - A runner is responsible for running jobs whenever an event happends and displays back the result.
    - It can be hosted by GitHub or one can have a self hosted runner.
    - A. GitHub Hosted Runners:
        - A GitHub Hosted Runners conists of pre-install softwares with virtual environments Linux , Windows or
          MacOS.
        - Pre-installed tools like curl,git,npm,yarn,pip etc.
        - It is maintained by GitHub.
        - One can not customized the hardware configuration of these Runners.
    - B. Self Hosted Runners:
        - A self hosted runners is a machine managed and maintain by that users with all required application
          installed.
        - One has more control of hardware, OS and software tools.
        - Ideally required to control hardware like an example add more memory for larger jobs or choose an OS
          not offered by GitHub Hosted Runners.
