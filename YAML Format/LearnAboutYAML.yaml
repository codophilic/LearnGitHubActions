# YAML is a data serialization language that is often used for writing configuration files. 
# Depending on whom you ask, YAML stands for yet another markup language or YAML ainâ€™t markup language 
# (a recursive acronym), which emphasizes that YAML is for data, not documents.
# It has KEY-VALUE pair sort of data.

#For lower identation use 2 spaces or 4 spaces

# key: [ key: value, key2: value2] (Understanding format)
key:
  - key: value
  - key2: value2

#Newkey: [ key: value, key2: 33, key3: [ key: value, key2: value2 ]] (Understanding format)
Newkey:
  - key: value

# JSON format also works in YAML. (Usually not used)

#Arrays
array:
  - item1
  - item2
  - Object: value #item having a key-value pair.
  - Object1: value1
# OR Another format in array.
NewArray: [ item1, item2, Object: value, Object1: value1 ]

#Array having multiple objects !!!!
ObjectArray:
  - keyA1: valueA1
    keyA2: valueA2
  - keyB1: valueB1
    keyB2: valueB2

ObjectNewArray: [ [ keyA1: valueA1, keyA2: valueA2 ], [ keyB1: valueB1, keyB2: valueB2 ]]
