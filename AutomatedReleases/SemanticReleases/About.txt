For releases we can use Semantic Versioning.
semantic-release is a Node CLI application, but it can be used to publish any type of packages. (https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/support/faq)
Semantic Version has some standard convections. (https://semver.org/)
it consists of 3 parts: Suppose my version is 2.1.3
MAJOR Version: 2 - This part gets updated when there are breaking changes. E.g suppose we have some open-source library can its consume by users and if we updated something in library which can break the code of other users.
MINOR Version: 1 - This parts gets updated when there are some functionality which does not have breaking changes like new features.
PATCH Version: 3 - Bug fixes.

convections commits
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

So first we need to create a release.config.js in our application and add the configuration for it.
